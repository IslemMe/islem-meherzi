The two communicate securely using Personal Access Tokens (PATs).\n\nWhy This Works\n✅ Your proprietary code stays private\n✅ You get unlimited free GitHub Actions minutes\n✅ You can showcase your automation process\n✅ Outputs (reports, dashboards) can be published without exposing source code\n✅ Perfect for reproducible research where methods are confidential but results should be shared"

    "section": "",
    "text": "TipWhat You’ll Learn\n\n\n\nBy the end of this post, you’ll know how to write an entire research paper inside RStudio - complete with live code, auto-generated figures, formatted references, and multiple output formats (Word, PDF, HTML)- all from a single source file.\nTime to read: ~8 minutes\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re a researcher using R and RStudio, you probably spend hours there every day: cleaning data, running analyses, creating visualizations, and building statistical models.\nBut then comes the hard part: writing the actual paper.\nSuddenly, you’re juggling\n\nExporting figures to PNG files\nCopy-pasting results into Word\nManaging citations in Zotero or Mendeley\nUpdating figures when your data changes (again!)\nDealing with formatting chaos before journal submission\n\nWhat if you could skip all of that?\nWith Quarto, your entire manuscript lives in RStudio alongside your code. When you update your analysis, your paper updates too—automatically. No more switching between tools. No more broken workflows.\n\n\n\nThink of Quarto as the next generation of R Markdown, but supercharged:\n✅ Works with R, Python, Julia, and Observable\n✅ Creates Word docs, PDFs, HTML pages, and even journal-ready formats\n✅ Handles citations, cross-references, and figure numbering automatically\n✅ Already built into modern versions of RStudio (no extra installation needed!)\nIt’s designed for exactly what you’re trying to do: turn your research into a publication-ready document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNew to R Markdown? Don’t worry! Quarto is beginner-friendly. If you can write in Word and copy-paste code, you can write with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s create a manuscript project in RStudio. It takes about 30 seconds:\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, go to: File → New Project\nChoose: New Directory → Quarto Manuscript\nName your project (e.g., my-paper)\nClick Create Project\n\nRStudio creates a complete manuscript structure for you:\nmy-paper/\n├── index.qmd          # Your main manuscript file (text + code)\n├── references.bib     # Bibliography file (citations go here)\n├── _quarto.yml        # Project settings (formats, styles, etc.)\n└── my-paper.Rproj     # RStudio project file\n\n\n\nOpen index.qmd and click Render. You’ll see a beautifully formatted manuscript with:\n\nTitle and author information\nSections (Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.)\nExample code chunks\nAuto-generated bibliography\n\nThat’s it! You now have a working manuscript template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 Prefer to Start with a Complete Example?\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve created a ready-to-use template with a demo research paper example (including plots, tables, and references).\nDownload: quarto-manuscript-demo on GitHub\nJust download, open in RStudio, and click Render. Follow the README for required instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index.qmd file is where your paper lives. Here’s what a simple manuscript looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteClick to view complete example manuscript code\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Impact of Exercise on Sleep Quality\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"2025-10-03\"\nformat:\n  html: default\n  docx: default\n  pdf: default\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe investigated the relationship between exercise frequency and sleep quality in 200 participants over 12 weeks.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSleep disorders affect millions of people worldwide [@smith2020]. \nRecent evidence suggests physical activity may improve sleep outcomes...\n\n## Methods\n\n### Data Collection\n\nWe recruited participants aged 25-65 and tracked their exercise habits using wearable devices.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Results\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, we found a positive correlation between exercise and sleep quality (r = 0.45, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML Header (the --- section at top): Contains your paper’s metadata\nMarkdown Sections: Use ## for main sections, ### for subsections\nCode Chunks: Wrapped in ```{r} ... ``` — runs when you render\nCitations: Use [@smith2020] to cite references from your .bib file\nFigure Labels: #| label: fig-name creates numbered, cross-referenceable figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTip: Use echo: false in code chunks to hide the code and show only the output. Perfect for final manuscripts!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest pain points in academic writing is citation management. Quarto makes it surprisingly simple.\n\n\n\nCreate a .bib file (already done if you used the template!)\nAdd references in BibTeX format\nCite them in your text using [@citationkey]\nRender → Quarto generates a formatted bibliography automatically\n\n\n\n\nIn references.bib:\n@article{smith2020,\n  title={The Science of Sleep and Exercise},\n  author={Smith, Jane and Johnson, Mark},\n  journal={Journal of Health Research},\n  year={2020},\n  volume={15},\n  pages={234-245}\n}\nIn your manuscript:\nRecent research shows strong correlations [@smith2020].\nResult: “Recent research shows strong correlations (Smith & Johnson, 2020).”\n\n\n\nWant APA? MLA? Nature? Just add one line to your YAML:\ncsl: apa.csl\nDownload any citation style from Zotero’s style repository(16,000+ styles available!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 My Personal Workflow: Building References with Zotero\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how I build my .bib files in under 5 minutes:\n\nInstall Zotero desktop app  (free reference manager)\nInstall Zotero browser connector to save papers with one click\nWhile browsing a paper online, click the Zotero extension → automatically saved!\nExport your library as BibTeX:\n\nRight-click your library → Export Library → Choose “BibTeX (.bib)”\nSave as references.bib in your manuscript folder\n\n\nDone! Quarto will read it automatically. No manual typing of citations needed.\nWhy Zotero? It’s free, cross-platform, syncs across devices, and integrates beautifully with Quarto, Word, and LaTeX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magic moment: turning your manuscript into a finished document.\n\n\nOption 1: Click the Render button in RStudio (top of editor)\nOption 2: Run in terminal: quarto render\n\n\n\nAfter rendering, check your project folder. You’ll find:\n_manuscript/\n├── index.html          # Beautiful HTML version\n├── index.docx          # Microsoft Word document\n├── index.pdf           # Professional PDF\n└── index_files/        # Supporting files (figures, etc.)\nAll three formats generated from the exact same source file.\n\n\n\nOpen index.html in a browser. In the top-right corner, you’ll see an “Other Formats” section:\n\n\n\nThe “Other Formats” menu lets readers download your paper as Word or PDF with one click.\n\n\nThis means:\n\n🌐 HTML for sharing online (blogs, lab websites)\n📄 Word for co-authors and supervisors who prefer track changes\n📕 PDF for journal submissions\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me tell you why researchers who switch to Quarto never go back:\n\n\nNo more: “Wait, which version of Figure 3 did I send to my co-author?”\nYour code, analysis, figures, text, and references are all in one file.\n\n\n\nChanged your data? Re-run the analysis. Render again. Every figure, table, and statistic updates instantly.\n\n\n\n\nSend collaborators the Word file for comments\nKeep the .qmd source as your master version\nIncorporate feedback and re-render\n\n\n\n\nOther researchers can download your project, run quarto render, and recreate your entire paper—figures, tables, statistics, everything.\n\n\n\nQuarto is plain text. It’ll open in 20 years. Try opening a Word 2003 .doc file today. Good luck. ==&gt; Quarto’s use of plain text makes it future-proof, unlike closed, proprietary formats that may become obsolete.\n\n\n\nQuarto can output to:\n\nJATS XML (for journal submissions)\nLaTeX (for traditional publishers)\nJupyter notebooks (for teaching)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what a complete Quarto manuscript looks like in practice:\n\nTitle & Authors with affiliations and ORCID IDs\nAbstract with keywords\nIntroduction with citations\nMethods section with inline code showing your analysis\nResults with auto-numbered figures and tables\nDiscussion interpreting findings\nReferences automatically formatted in your chosen style\nSupplementary Materials (appendices, extra figures)\n\nAll of this renders to professional HTML, Word, and PDF formats.\nSee it in action: Download my complete example manuscript to explore the full structure.\n\n\n\nReady to write your next paper in RStudio? Here’s your roadmap:\n\nInstall/update RStudio (Quarto comes built-in)\nCreate a new Quarto Manuscript project\nExplore the template structure\nAdd your data and analysis code\nWrite your manuscript sections\nAdd references to references.bib\nCite them in your text with [@key]\nRender to HTML, Word, and PDF\nShare with collaborators!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nStuck or want to learn more?\nCheck out the official Quarto documentation, it’s excellent and beginner-friendly!\n\n\n\n\n\nMost researchers already live in RStudio for their analysis. Why not stay there for writing too?\nWith Quarto Manuscript, you can:\n\nWrite your paper where your code lives\nUpdate figures and results automatically\nManage citations effortlessly\n\nExport to any format your journal requires\nMake your research fully reproducible\n\nThe best part? Once you set it up, writing becomes easier. No more juggling tools. No more version control nightmares. Just research, writing, and results: all in one place.\nStart small: take one section of your current paper and try writing it in Quarto. You’ll immediately see why this approach is the future of academic writing.\n\nThanks for reading! If you found this helpful, download the demo template and give it a try. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, happy to help!"

Quarto makes it surprisingly simple.\n\n\n\nCreate a .bib file (already done if you used the template!)\nAdd references in BibTeX format\nCite them in your text using [@citationkey]\nRender → Quarto generates a formatted bibliography automatically\n\n\n\n\nIn references.bib:\n@article{smith2020,\n  title={The Science of Sleep and Exercise},\n  author={Smith, Jane and Johnson, Mark},\n  journal={Journal of Health Research},\n  year={2020},\n  volume={15},\n  pages={234-245}\n}\nIn your manuscript:\nRecent research shows strong correlations [@smith2020].\nResult: “Recent research shows strong correlations (Smith & Johnson, 2020).”\n\n\n\nWant APA? MLA? Nature? Just add one line to your YAML:\ncsl: apa.csl\nDownload any citation style from Zotero’s style repository(16,000+ styles available!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip💡 My Personal Workflow: Building References with Zotero\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how I build my .bib files in under 5 minutes:\n\nInstall Zotero desktop app  (free reference manager)\nInstall Zotero browser connector to save papers with one click\nWhile browsing a paper online, click the Zotero extension → automatically saved!\nExport your library as BibTeX:\n\nRight-click your library → Export Library → Choose “BibTeX (.bib)”\nSave as references.bib in your manuscript folder\n\n\nDone! Quarto will read it automatically. No manual typing of citations needed.\nWhy Zotero? It’s free, cross-platform, syncs across devices, and integrates beautifully with Quarto, Word, and LaTeX."

    "text": "Want to beat procrastination and draft faster?\nHere are some of the most effective tips I’ve gathered that truly work.\n\n\n\nStop editing as you write! Your first draft is about getting ideas down, not grammar or polish.\n\nEditing too early wastes time and fuels procrastination.\n\nSave grammar, clarity, and formatting for later rounds.\n\n✅ Perfectionism = procrastination. A rough draft builds clarity and momentum.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a plan that simplifies writing and saves time:\n\nStructure first: Outline using your target journal’s template.\n\nWrite key sections first (Methods, Results).\n\nIntro/Abstract last: they’ll be sharper once your content is final.\n\nDraft fast: Aim for 1 section/day. Quarto’s dynamic formatting/code tools remove friction.\n\nRevise after drafting: Polishing a full draft is faster and more motivating than fixing fragments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfectionism slows you down — draft first, polish later.\n\nWriting a rough Version 0 clears mental blocks and creates momentum.\n\nQuarto Manuscript helps you stay focused on ideas, not formatting.\n\n\n💡 Want to try these methods? Start with your next project: create a Quarto outline, commit to Version 0, and watch how much faster your draft grows.\n\nThanks for stopping by! Hope you found something useful :)"

    "text": "Want to beat procrastination and draft faster?\nHere are some of the most effective tips I’ve gathered that truly work.\n\n\n\nStop editing as you write! Your first draft is about getting ideas down, not grammar or polish.\n\nEditing too early wastes time and fuels procrastination.\n\nSave grammar, clarity, and formatting for later rounds.\n\n✅ Perfectionism = procrastination. A rough draft builds clarity and momentum.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a plan that simplifies writing and saves time:\n\nStructure first: Outline using your target journal’s template.\n\nWrite key sections first (Methods, Results).\n\nIntro/Abstract last: they’ll be sharper once your content is final.\n\nDraft fast: Aim for 1 section/day. Quarto’s dynamic formatting/code tools remove friction.\n\nRevise after drafting: Polishing a full draft is faster and more motivating than fixing fragments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfectionism slows you down — draft first, polish later.\n\nWriting a rough Version 0 clears mental blocks and creates momentum.\n\nQuarto Manuscript helps you stay focused on ideas, not formatting.\n\n\n💡 Want to try these methods? Start with your next project: create a Quarto outline, commit to Version 0, and watch how much faster your draft grows.\n\nThanks for stopping by! Hope you found something useful :)"

    "text": "Sometimes you need to share your updated reports with a restricted group of people instead of publishing them openly. A practical and secure way is to automate sending your reports by email. With Quarto and R, you can render your reports, attach them as PDF or HTML, and deliver them directly to your recipients’ inboxes.\nIn this post, I will show you how to achieve this with R and Quarto, using Gmail as an example.\n\n\n\nTo allow R to send emails from your Gmail account, you must create a Gmail App Password. This is safer than using your main password.\n\nEnable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account Security settings.\n\nGo to the App Passwords page.\nChoose the app and device (e.g., Mail → Other → “R script”).\nClick Generate. Google will display a 16-character password.\nCopy and save this password immediately, as it cannot be viewed again later.\n\nThis password is what you will use in your R script instead of your usual Gmail password.\n\n\n\nBelow is a complete R script that renders your Quarto report (report.qmd), produces PDF and HTML versions, and sends them as email attachments. You only need to replace the email addresses and the Gmail App Password.\n\n# --- Load packages ---\nlibrary(quarto)\nlibrary(blastula)\n\n# --- Step 1: Render your Quarto report into PDF and HTML ---\nquarto_render(\"report.qmd\", output_format = \"pdf\")\nquarto_render(\"report.qmd\", output_format = \"html\")\n\n# --- Step 2: Create the email body ---\nemail &lt;- compose_email(\n  body = md(\"\n  Hello,  \n\n  The updated Quarto report is ready.  \n  Please find both PDF and HTML versions attached.  \n\n  Best regards,  \n  Islem\n  \")\n)\n\n# --- Step 3: Attach the reports ---\nemail &lt;- add_attachment(email, file = \"report.pdf\")\nemail &lt;- add_attachment(email, file = \"report.html\")\n\n# --- Step 4: Send the email ---\nsmtp_send(\n  email,\n  from = \"your_email@gmail.com\",\n  to = c(\"recipient1@example.com\", \"recipient2@example.com\"),\n  subject = paste0(\"Updated Report - \", Sys.Date()),\n  credentials = creds(\n    host = \"smtp.gmail.com\",\n    port = 587,\n    user = \"your_email@gmail.com\",\n    use_ssl = TRUE\n  )\n)\n# The app password will be requested interactively in a popup after running, no need to hard-code it\n\n\n\n\nTo make this fully automated:\n\nOn Windows, schedule the script with taskscheduleR.\nOn Linux/macOS, use cronR or add it to your system cron jobs.\nEvery time the script runs, your Quarto report will be rendered and sent to the selected users automatically.\n\n\n\n\nEmail automation is not the only way to share Quarto reports with restricted users:\n\nNetlify with password protection: host your Quarto site and restrict access with a password.\nGitHub Actions or GitLab CI: automate report rendering and emailing or publishing.\nPosit Connect: enterprise solution that provides user access control, scheduling, and automatic email notifications out of the box.\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your context and your audience’s needs.\n\n\n\nFor many small teams or individuals, automating email delivery is a quick, safe, and effective way to share Quarto reports with a limited group of users. By combining Quarto, R, and the blastula package, you can render, attach, and distribute updated reports with minimal effort."
